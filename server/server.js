This line tells Express to parse incoming requests with URL-encoded payloadsâ€”which is commonly used when submitting HTML forms.
When a client (like an HTML form) submits data using:
<form method="POST" action="/submit">
  <input type="text" name="username" />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
Express doesn't automatically parse the form data. So you need express.urlencoded() middleware to make req.body work in your route.

    Checks if your app is running in production mode (e.g., on a live server like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS).
    This prevents the React app from being served during local development, where you'd use npm start in the React folder.

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/build')));

    Serves the React compiled frontend (from the client/build folder) as static files.
    path.join(__dirname, '../client/build') combines your current backend folder path with the relative path to the React build folder.
    express.static(...) makes those files (like index.html, bundle.js, etc.) accessible by the browser.
